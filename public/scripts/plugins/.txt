1. Nepotism or John has more employeable qualityies, or Emily didn't present herself well. 
    The company likes how productive she is in her role and wants to keep her in a low position.
    Being compentent and producitive are not neccisiarily traits worthy of promotion.
    

2. Employees may feel like there is a glass ceiling, this can make them not feel valued in the comapany. 
    Employees might like that Emily didn't get promoted because she makes the rest of them look bad.

3. Talk to HR about how to make promotion opportunities more transparent, talk to boss directly. 





Some factors behind promotion could be diversity based, nepotism, it's really hard to assume.
Impact of this could be low morale in keystone team memebers who aren't vocal, perceptions of glass ceilings, worker distrust,
feeling unseen, undervalued, and not allowed to grow as a worker and person.

A lot of potential for miscommunication. 
Emily should make her intention of vertical movement more clear to management, be more assertive. 
Present self well. 
Leave if not valued.

Keep in mind, being compentent and producitive are not neccisiarily traits worthy of promotion.
